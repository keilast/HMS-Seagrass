```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Install and Library Packages

```{r packages, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("hmsc-r/HMSC", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"))
library(Hmsc)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
